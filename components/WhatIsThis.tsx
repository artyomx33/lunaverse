            <strong>A 3-day in-person intensive.</strong> Not a retreat. Not a workshop. An installation of a complete operating system designed for operators who are tired of leaving 70% of their potential on the table.
          </p>

          <p>
            You'll learn directly from someone who builds 7-figure businesses using Claude, GPT, Supabase, and absolutely no fluff. Every tactic is from real operations. Every framework has been battle-tested. You get access to the exact systems, templates, and decision-trees that work.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Day 1:</strong> Install brutal clarity into your thinking. Build your personal OS and AI workflows.
            <br/>
            <strong>Day 2:</strong> Live building. Code, design, strategy in real-time. See how fast is actually possible.
            <br/>
            <strong>Day 3:</strong> Your 90-day execution roadmap. The exact path from chaos to domination.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the end, you won't just have templates. You'll be a different operator—one with clarity, speed, and the systems to back it up.
